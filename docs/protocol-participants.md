# Protocol Participants
Wrap Protocol ecosystem consists of 3 main participants; namely, Users, Signers Quorum, Developers, which altogether make up the Wrap Community.

### Signers Quorum
Wrap relies on a strong off-chain federation, called the Signers Quorum. The Signers Quorum ensures that, at any given time, the number of wrapped tokens (called wTokens) issued on the Tezos blockchain corresponds to the number of original tokens locked on Ethereum.

The Signers Quorum currently consists of Bender Labs, Bake N Rolls, Baking Bad, Blockscale, and MadFish, with the possibility of adding more members in the future.  Each member of the Signers Quorum controls one key of both the ETH Quorum and the TEZ Quorum. They process wrapping and unwrapping transactions, maintain a 1-1 peg between tokens locked on Ethereum and tokens issued on Tezos and add more assets to the list of assets supported by Wrap Protocol.

Signers watch both blockchains and create and sign relevant transactions for both the Deposit Contract and the Minter Contract.

### Users
People and entities who use Wrap Protocol to wrap ERC20 tokens into FA2 tokens. Users earn WRAP governance tokens as rewards for wrapping ERC20 tokens into FA2 tokens. Users can stake their WRAPs to farm wTokens on Wrap Protocol. Users also engage in Liquidity ming for wToken/XTZ pairs on Quipuswap.

### Developers
Wrap is an open-source project and it welcomes contributions from interested members of the Wrap community who have the technical expertise to contribute to the development. Wrap Protocol code repository [is available on Github](https://github.com/bender-labs). 

There is currently a 15K Wrap bounty for coding an auto-staking to manage all staking operations (stake, unstake, claim) in a batch. [See more details here](https://community.benderlabs.io/t/15k-wrap-bounty-autostaking-feature/150).
