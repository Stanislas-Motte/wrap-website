# Introduction

## Wrap Protocol Overview
Welcome to Wrap Protocol.

Wrap Protocol is a decentralized bridge between the Ethereum and Tezos blockchains enabling anyone to wrap native ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum into native FA2 tokens on Tezos.

Wrap Protocol has the $WRAP governance token, a utility token allowing participants in the Wrap Protocol to vote on protocol upgrades, parameters change, and to access a portion of the fees generated by the wrapping activity.

## Core Concept

Wrap Protocol brings liquidity to Tezos and solves the cross-chain interoperability problem in a decentralized yet easily usable fashion. Wrap allows anyone to wrap ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain into FA2 tokens on Tezos, then use them on Tezos-native DeFi protocols.

Wrap Protocol is an open-source project that relies on a strong federation  (Signers Quorum) that guarantees its stability and a community of $WRAP governance token holders. Bender Labs, the main contributor to Wrap Protocol,  is on a mission to build an open financial system on Tezos.

Wrap Protocol is the first step towards that mission and the protocol is designed as a quick-to-implement, easy to use and understand, and with a reasonably low level of trust decentralized protocol that will allow to quickly and securely bring assets and liquidity on Tezos.

Wrap Protocol is built with 3 core design choices, namely,
 - Openness: open source protocol designed to be permissionless and uncensorable.
 - Pragmatism: code quality matters as much as the usability of the protocol
 - User ownership: owned by users through $WRAP governance tokens.
