# Governance
## Wrap DAO
Wrap Protocol is a community-owned project. The is incentivized to be actively involved the direction and development of the protocol. See examples of community participation in the direction of the protocol below:

 - Update on Wrap Tokenomics In Response to Community Feedback
 - Update on Community Poll to Change the Allocation of Wrap Rewards

As the Wrap community grows, $WRAP holders will be able to form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This DAO will have two categories of  governance power over Wrap Protocol

### On-chain, automated governance:
The DAO can vote on-chain on the parameters of the protocol and change them using BaseDAO. Ex: wrapping fees level for Quorum members.

Specifically with, On-chain Governance, the DAO can vote on:

__Wrap Protocol Fee Structure__
 - Wrapping/Unwrapping Fees Level
 - Fee Recipient Addresses
 - Fee Split between Recipients

__$WRAP Token Characteristics__
 - Max Supply
 - Distribution Function
 - Distribution frequency and date
 - $WRAP Recipient Addresses
 - $WRAP Split between Recipient

### Off-chain, manual or consultative governanceâ€‹

The DAO can vote off-chain on a certain number of topics using Snapshot-like tools. Ex: vote on new assets to add to Wrap.

With off-chain Governance, the community can vote (in a consultative or binding way) on pretty much any topic related to Wrap Protocol using similar tools as Snapshot (Tezos version implemented in BaseDAO).
