# Wrap v2
 - __Decentralization of Signers Quorum__
 - __Adding incentives such as rewards and bonds__
 - __Implementation of a DAO of $WRAP token holders__
 - __Adding more assets to Wrap Protocol__

Wrap v2 delivers significant iteration and updates on the first version of Wrap Protocol. In addition to feature updates, one of the most significant features of Wrap v2 will be the decentralization of Signers Quorum and the strengthening of its consensus.

By adding incentives such as rewards and bonds, we will further reinforce the strength of the federation - and lower the level of trust required by users. Additionally, we will include a process for adding new signers and removing malicious members of the quorum.

The second important feature will be the implementation of a DAO of $WRAP token holders. Using the BaseDAO framework, we will allow $WRAP holders to vote on important parameters of the protocol, such as the level of fees and their attribution.

Last but not least, we will add more assets to the protocol, to bring even more liquidity to Tezos.
