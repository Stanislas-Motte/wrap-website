# Tokenomics

### $WRAP Governance Token

$WRAP is an ERC20 token 100% wrapped into an FA2 token using Wrap Protocol.

The total supply of $WRAP is 100mm tokens initially. This can be modified by the $WRAP DAO at a later stage.

$WRAP is issued on Ethereum and locked on Tezos as follows:
1. Mint 100mm $WRAP as standard ERC20 tokens on the ETH blockchain
2. Wrap 100m $WRAP using Wrap Protocol and send them to the $WRAP Distribution
3. Smart Contract on Tezos
The $WRAP Distributor contract then manages the distribution of $WRAP on the Tezos blockchain.
